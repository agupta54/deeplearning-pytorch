## Overview of tensors in PyTorch
A neural network is a function. Py-Torch neural networks are composed of Python centers.
It consists of an input tensor $ x $ and an output tensor $ y $ and the network will be composed of a set of parameters. These are also tensors. A neural network will be comprised of a series of tensor operations.
Tensor can be of many types like double or integer. we can convert to a rectangular tensor. It is not so difficult to convert numpy arrays to pytorch tensors and vice versa. This gives pytorch tremendous capabilities to work in the python ecosystem.
